# Project2_Corvinus

## Overview
This project utilizes R language to interpret the relationship between tech exports and other significant variables such as education, R&D expenditure, patent applications, and GDP using time series analysis. The primary goal is to understand how these variables interact and influence tech exports over time.

## Descriptive Statistics
The analysis begins with generating descriptive statistics to summarize the data. Key insights include the distribution of tech exports proportion, R&D expenditure, education levels, patent applications, and GDP across different countries and years. These statistics provide a foundational understanding of the data's central tendencies, dispersion, and overall distribution.

## Graphical Analysis
Several scatter plots and correlation matrices were generated to visually explore the relationships between variables. For instance:
- Scatter plots of tech export proportion vs. R&D expenditure, education, patent applications, and GDP highlight the varying degrees of correlation between these variables.
- Correlation matrices further quantify these relationships, providing a clear overview of how each variable is associated with tech exports.

## Analysis Process
The analysis process involved several key steps:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Initial steps included removing rows with missing values and outliers that could skew the results.
2. **Data Transformation:** Variables were transformed for better interpretation, such as calculating the tech export proportion.
3. **Descriptive Statistics:** Summary statistics were generated to understand the data's distribution.
4. **Graphical Analysis:** Scatter plots and correlation matrices were used to visualize relationships between variables.
5. **Time Series Analysis:** The data was analyzed over time to identify trends and patterns in tech exports and their relationship with other variables.

## Significance of Findings
The findings from this project shed light on the complex interplay between tech exports and factors like R&D expenditure, education, patent applications, and GDP. Notably, the analysis reveals:
- A positive correlation between tech exports and R&D expenditure, suggesting that higher investment in research and development is associated with increased tech exports.
- The influence of education and patent applications on tech exports, indicating that human capital and innovation play crucial roles in a country's tech export capabilities.
- The varying impact of GDP on tech exports, highlighting the importance of economic context in understanding tech export performance.

These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors driving tech exports and can inform policy decisions aimed at enhancing a country's technological competitiveness.

## Corrected Time Series Analysis and Interpretation
The time series analysis has been meticulously corrected to ensure the accurate application of ARIMA and ARMA models for forecasting. This section outlines the corrections made, summarizes the results, and interprets their significance.

### Corrections Made
The initial analysis was refined by ensuring the data was stationary before applying the ARIMA and ARMA models. This was achieved by incorporating the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to check for stationarity and adjusting the models accordingly.

### Summary of Results and Their Interpretation
The corrected time series analysis provides a more accurate forecast of tech exports, revealing insights into future trends. The ARIMA and ARMA models, now properly applied, offer a clearer understanding of the dynamics influencing tech exports. The analysis highlights the importance of considering historical data patterns and their impact on future projections.

### Insights into Future Trends
The corrected analysis underscores the potential for growth in tech exports, driven by factors such as R&D expenditure, education, and innovation. By accurately forecasting future trends, this analysis aids in strategic planning and policy formulation aimed at bolstering a country's tech export capabilities.

## Enhancements to Project Quality
To further improve the quality of the project, several enhancements have been implemented:

### Automated Testing for Data Integrity and Model Accuracy
Automated testing scripts have been introduced to ensure the reliability of analysis results. These scripts perform checks on data integrity and model accuracy, providing an additional layer of validation for the analysis process.

### Inclusion of a Broader Set of Variables
The analysis now incorporates a more diverse set of variables, including political stability and digital infrastructure quality. This expansion provides a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing tech exports, allowing for a richer analysis of the interplay between tech exports and various determinants.

### Addressing Multicollinearity in Regression Models
Multicollinearity issues in regression models have been addressed by excluding highly correlated variables or using dimensionality reduction techniques. This approach enhances the validity of the models, ensuring more reliable and interpretable results.

These enhancements contribute to the overall improvement of the project, ensuring a more robust and comprehensive analysis of tech exports and their influencing factors.
